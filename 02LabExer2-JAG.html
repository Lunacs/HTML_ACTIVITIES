        and a markup language for Web pages that we may use to construct our own website.
        And I'm already familiar with HTML's fundamental structure.

      <p align ="left"> - So far, I've learnt that HTML is a markup language used to define the structure of content on a webpage.<br>
           I learnt about content and the various tags that structure it so that it displays properly on pages. <br> 
           Finally, I learnt how to create text by utilizing text formatting elements or tags such as bold text, italic text, smaller text, and many more.
